### [JSL11] Agile Board - Kanban Task Management App

Welcome to the Agile Board project, the final project for the JSL course! In this portfolio piece project, you will be stepping into the shoes of a juniour developer tasked with bringing a Kanban Task Management App to life. You're not starting from scratch, though. In this project, you are tasked with tackling the provided user stories to both identify and fix bugs in the code, as well as to develop your own functions to extend the application's capabilities. Key assignments include importing utility functions, initializing data, and diving into debugging tasks such as setting up data correctly in local storage, dynamically displaying boards and tasks, and enhancing user interactions.

Additionally, you will enhance the application by crafting code to meet specific functionalities outlined in the user stories, like managing task details and their lifecycle, toggling theme customization, and ensuring the persistence of data through local storage. This blend of debugging and creative coding invites you to apply your critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a hands-on manner, equipping you for the intricacies of real-world software development scenarios.

We're providing you with a head start:

- **Starter Code**: You will receive starter code for the user interface (UI) of the application. This includes the basic layout and some of the JavaScript (JS) functionality needed to make the app interactive.

- **Your Mission**: Your main task is to complete the app by implementing the features described in the provided user stories. These stories outline the functionality that users expect from the app, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as customizing themes and managing the task lifecycle.

- **ðŸª²Important Note on DebuggingðŸš¨:** In the sections of the project where you are tasked with debugging the code, *it's crucial to focus on identifying and correcting errors within the existing functions rather than undertaking a complete refactoring of the code.* This means you will need to carefully analyze the provided starter code to pinpoint syntax errors, logical mistakes, or any bugs that prevent the application from functioning as intended. **The goal is to improve and repair the codebase by making precise adjustments, ensuring that the original structure, function logic and intended functionality are preserved.** This approach not only aligns with the project's requirements but also hones the essential skill of debuggingâ€” a critical competency for any developer.

## Feedback:
This project was very challenging, I personally had no idea what I was doing in the beginning. As time went on though, I slowly understood what was required of me. 

## Challenges:
I had a lot of challenges in this project but I got to understand them the more I did my research and the asked for help. I had a lot of errors and some of the features were not functioning they way they were supposed to. Some of them are still not functioning the way they're supposed to due to not having enough time to complete this project. I am still working on the project in order to find my mistakes and make sure the whole code functions well.
